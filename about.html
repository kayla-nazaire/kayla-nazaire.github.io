  <p> Hi! I am a junior journalism major at the University of Maryland, College Park. My primary interest is multimedia journalism and broadcast. I am currently a freelance writer for two on campus publications: The Diamondback and The Black Explosion. I've also worked in radio as the host of "Pocket Change", a pop culture show at WMUC.
    </p>
  <p>My hometown is Frederick, MD. I'm a first generation Haitian-American and the Vice-President of the Caribbean Student Association here at Maryland. I'm also a member of the Caribbean Dance Troupe on campus: Riddim Ryderz.
